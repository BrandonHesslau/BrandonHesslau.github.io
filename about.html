                <p>Hi there!</p>
				<p>
				My name is Brandon Hesslau, and I am a software engineer passionate about game development. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I first fell in love with programming and game development in high school and have been pursuing it ever since. I studied computer science with a focus on real-time game systems at DePaul University, and I’m proud to say I graduated in 2021. 
				</p>
				<p>
				With the strong desire to turn my passion into a profession, I took a chance and co-founded an indie game studio with some dear friends during my last year of college. We decided to call it Not a Sailor Studios. Together, we developed and released a game called Buddy Simulator 1984, a concept that had been sitting in my notebook since my freshman year. Somehow, we were lucky enough that our game found fans who love it as much as we do, which still shocks us today.
				</p>
				<p>
				Additionally, I have experience working with various programming languages such as C++, C#, Python, Java, and Lua. I excel using Unity 3D but am also proficient in Unreal Engine. I have extensive knowledge and experience with gameplay systems, game engine development, tool development, and graphics programming.
				</p>
				<p>
				In my free time, I’m often working on new projects, whether it be developing game prototypes, creating tools to help other developers, composing music, or exploring experimental ideas that pique my interests. 
				</p>
				<p>
				To me, programming is not solely a technical pursuit, but a creative one. Technical problems often require creative solutions, while creative problems often require technical intervention, and nothing brings me more joy than arriving at a solution for myself or for my team. 
				</p>
				<p>
				If you’re looking for a skilled and passionate developer who will make your problems his own, I’m your guy. I look forward to hearing from you.
				</p>

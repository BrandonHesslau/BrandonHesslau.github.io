      <b>Desktop Survivors 98</b> is a Windows-98-themed horde survival game that plays directly on the player’s desktop. 
    The project was built from the ground up using a custom MonoGame-based engine, optimized for high-performance object management, low-level rendering access, minimal file size, and seamless desktop compositing.

                                <p>When starting this system, I knew I wanted it to be very abstract so I only had to worry about behavior specfic to each move. I wanted to be able to quickly create new move scripts by inheriting all of the information that would be shared among each move. 
                                For instance, I knew each move could have different types of inputs such as a single tap or a mash, and I didn't want to redefine this behavior evertime. So, I started by defining a <b>FriendlyEncounterMove</b> class which would be the base of all friendly combat moves throughout the game. <i>Note: The system for enemy moves works similary.</i></p>

As you can see, the <i>InitiateButtonTap, Succeed, Fail, and Critical</i> are all overriden from the base FriendlyEncounterMove class.

                  <h3><b>Project Highlight:</b> Procedural Level Generation</h3>
                  <p>The following demonstrates a brief overview of my procedural generation system.</p>
                    <div>
                        <div class="slide-content">
                            <div class="text">
                                <p>The goal of the proceural generator was the generate a dynamic tile-based building that felt natural. We weren't making a dungeon crawler where you were always inside. The world had to have interiors and exteriors. At the beginning of this project, I knew the level generation system was going to be the most difficult, which is why it was the first thing I tackled. Originally, I had built a procedural generation system that was fairly quick, but was definitely brute-forced. 
                                    It would behave well until you started to add many rooms to the structures. It would attempt to fit and rotate all of the room "blueprints" until it found a solution. Also, all of the walls were individual game objects which would cause some FPS issues if not used carefully. So instead, I eventually scrapped it and started fresh with a new idea that used multi-threading and recursive methods, as well as dynamically generated meshes.</p>
                              </div>
                              <div class="text">
                                <p>
                                The <i>structure</i> of my generator became as follows: A Building contains a set of Room Regions, and a Room Region contains a set of Rooms. This was so rooms could feel naturally placed. For instance, if I was generating a school, I could have a defined area where classrooms could spawn, as opposed to scattering them throughout the building.
                                This also made the placement process quicker. A Room Region is ultimately just a large block of space, and it's a lot easier to find optimal placement for fewer large spaces, then many small ones.
                                </p>
                              </div>
                              <div class="text">
                                <p>
                                To make the generation process quicker, I wanted to build a system that could "look ahead" for an optimal placement instead of just placing rooms until something works.
                                So, I built a process that would behave as follows. First, pick a random position in the Building's space and place a <i>fake</i> room region. 
                                Using this room region as the starting point, recursively attempt to place the next <i>fake</i> region and divide it into rooms. This new room region is now the starting point.
                                After the placement of all room regions have been visited, the generation system now knows where the optimal placements are for the starting room region and can quickly generate random building layouts.
                                This same behavior would also behave with multiple floors as well.                 
                                </p>
                              </div>
                              <div class="text">
                                <p>
                                Since this behavior didn't technically require Unity to perform, I was able to run the calculations on a separate thread so Unity could still perform in runtime. This made it so we could easily integrate loading screens and other ways to keep the player entertained while the generator was running.
                                </p>
                              </div>

                                Here's the final core loop of the generator. I wanted to make sure each step was organized and clear, especially when debugging.

                            So I decided to build an in-house room editor tool that would integrate directly into the generation system. It ended up being a really fun tool to use.
                            All of the blueprints would save as JSON files and would be loaded into RoomBlueprint.cs Scriptable Objects which each Building blueprint would contain.
                            With this tool we could create as many layouts as we wanted, and they would all be compatible with the level generator. Here's a clip of it in action:

                <p><b>Isolation Station</b> is a more recent experimental horror project that I've been developing independently. In the game, you play as an astronaut who crash lands on an icy planet and becomes trapped in their shipped.
                    In order to survive,you must program a robot to explore the planet and read the data that the robot returns with.
                    But, while doing this the player must be careful because something else lives on this planet too. The project features an eerily isolating atmosphere, unique world exploration mechanic, and a terrifying creature that stalks from the outside.
                    Isolation Station is currently an incomplete project.

                <p><b>Ram n' Oodles</b> is a game that was made as part of a 48 hour game jam in 2022. It's a wave-based surival game with optional couch co-op where you
                    play as a set of two robots who are attached by a wire. One robot controls movement and the other controls shooting. Working  together, they must survive a bug apocolypse in a post-human world.
                    Along the way, you collect bug meat to purchase ramen noodles, which provide the robots with some fun upgrades.</p>

                <p><b>A Game About Literally Doing Your Taxes</b> is a game that was made as part of a 48 hour game jam in 2019. It's a comedic, psychological horror game where the player must sort through papers to "do taxes".
                    After the game was released, it gained quite a lot traction on social media and actually sparked our motivation for starting an indie game studio.</p>

                <p><b>Letter Valley</b> is a unique word-based puzzle game I was experimenting with for mobile. 
                    Each level of the game gives you chunks of a phrase. In order to complete the level, you must place the word "blocks" in the correct positions and orientations.
                    The game features fun word puzzle designs, a unique word game mechanic, and satisfying transitional animations. I also designed a custom level editor tool for this project to streamline the creation of levels.
                    Letter Valley is currently incomplete.</p>
